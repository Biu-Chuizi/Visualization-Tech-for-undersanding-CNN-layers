In order to obtain the hidden-layer representation, we will first truncate the model at the LSTM layer. Thereafter, we will load the model with the weights that the model has learnt. A better way to do this is create a new model with the same steps (until the layer you want) and load the weights from the model. Layers in Keras models are iterable.
